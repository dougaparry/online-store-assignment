# Online store/ catalog

This project was part of a university assignment to create a website using Python and Django

## Brief

Write a web application in which you maintain a catalogue for an online store. There should be a browsable front-end and a backend for maintaining products. Consider the design and security of your application.

## Features:

The site feature a front end where users can browse various products. Each product is assigned to differnet categories with each category having its own, dynamically populated product page. If products are selected they open in their own page with more information about them. 

The site was developed using Django and bootstrap so it is responsive. In addition to this, a backend was created, allowing the sites administrator to add new products on the fly, as well as edit products when necessary. These products are dynamically displayed in the store, in cards not disimilar to the layout on pinterest. The administrator can also add new categories with new headings and product types. 

The site almost functions as an ecommerce store - it just needs the addition of a cart and payment facilities.
