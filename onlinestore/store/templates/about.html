  		<p>Douglas & sons was founded in 1888 by Douglas Douglas to provide high quality menswear products to the discerning London gentlemen. 
  			This tradition was past on to his sons and on to theirs in turn. This website is the continuation of this proud tradition. 
  			Douglas & sons can now reach the far-flung corners of the world, bringing style and sophistication to anyone who desires it. 
  			Douglas & sons prides itself on its many exlcusive relationships it enjoys with its partner fashion suppliers. 
  			This often results in exclusive and early release products available only from this online store, before anywhere else in the world. </p>
